# Snake-Game
## Project Description

This repository contains the Python code for a classic Snake game, implemented using the turtle module. The game features a snake that the player controls using keyboard inputs to eat food and grow in size. The project is divided into four main files:

- **main.py**: Sets up the game environment, including the screen, game loop, and integrates other components.
- **snake.py**: Defines the Snake class, responsible for creating the snake, handling its movement, and growth.
- **food.py**: Contains the Food class, which randomly generates food items on the screen.
- **score.py**: Implements the ScoreBoard class to display and update the player's score.

## Gameplay
- Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- Eating food increases the score and lengthens the snake.
- Game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

## Installation and Running the Game
- Requires Python and the turtle module.
- Clone the repository and run main.py.
